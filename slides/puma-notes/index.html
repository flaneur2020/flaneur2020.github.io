# quick note on puma

## preload_app or phased-restart?

## We love puma because it's memory efficient, and modern.

- a good multi-threaded code base

- "Real parallism" in non-GIL implementations( like jruby & rubinius )

- multi-processes support

- hot-deploy / phased restart

## But sometimes we just take shit ( aka.*"掉坑"* )

- when we met problem, we goolge for stackoverflow

- then copy & paste their configuration snippets

.footnote[ most time, we just copy solutions but don't take care of *why* ]


---

## For example, we got an Redis::InheritedError

after some googling, we found a reasonable stackoverflow post:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18720693/reconnect-with-redis-after-puma-fork

we add these snippet to our puma.rb:

```
on_restart do
  $redis.reconnect
  Rails.cache.reconnect if Rails.cache.respond_to? :reconnect
  ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) do
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
  end
end

on_worker_boot do
  $redis.reconnect
  Rails.cache.reconnect if Rails.cache.respond_to? :reconnect
  ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) do
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
  end
end
```

then the problem seems disappeared, happily ever after.

## But it's actually not the fundamental problem of puma

the root cause is *preload_app*

- like Unicorn, puma can preload the rack App to its master process, then just fork workers, without the repeated initializations in each process, *fast*.

- it take advantages of COW *(Copy-on-Write)*, load once, one in-memory code base.

- also, we have COW friendly Garbage Collector, which helps us save memory.

Promising, but...

## The problem of preload_app

- you have to reconnect all your connections

  - how can we did not miss **any** connection?

- can not take advantage of **phased restart**

---

## Modes

- **Single Mode**

  - single process, multi-threaded

  - *hot restart*: restart after killed all threads, keep connections live but block

- **Clustered Mode**

  - multi processes, multi-threaded

  - *hot restart*: restart after killed all processes

  - *phased restart*: really zero-downtime, keep connections live and do not block

---

## Phased-restart
  
- start new then kill old one by one

  - if starting a new process failed, do not kill any old worker

- each process is initialized by itself

  - takes N-times longger than hot-restart + preload_app

- two versions co-exists during restarting, we have to take care of keeping schema compatible between deploys.

  - however, we have to keep schema compatible between deploys in most cases

- don't compatible with preload_app

  - master process will act as a stateless *supervisor*, instead of a *preloader*

  - do not need `reconnect!` any more

---

## Phased-restart sample

```
kill -s SIGUSR1 `cat tmp/pids/puma.pid`
```

## Our new configuration

remove `preload_app!` and the reconnections:

```
RAILS_ROOT = File.expand_path(File.dirname(File.dirname(__FILE__)))

# bind  "unix://#{SHARED_ROOT}/sockets/puma.sock"
bind "tcp://0.0.0.0:23333"
pidfile "#{RAILS_ROOT}/tmp/pids/puma.pid"
state_path "#{RAILS_ROOT}/tmp/pids/puma.state"

# 不在 master 线程装载 bundler 环境
prune_bundler

# 线程池大小为 8
threads 8, 8

# 进程池大小为 3，即应用服务器的 CPU 数 + 1
workers 3
```
