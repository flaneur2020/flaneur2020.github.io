> Algorithmic trading, as defined here, is the use of an automated system for carrying out trades, which are executed in a pre-determined manner via an algorithm specifically _without any human intervention_.

### 2.1.1 Advantages

- Historical Assessment：**Backtesting** allows the (prior) statistical properties of the strategy to be determined, providing insight into whether a strategy is likely to be profitable in the future.
- Efficiency：比人工操作更高效；自动化风险管理和头寸管理，**能够动态地控制杠杆和风险水平**；
- No Discretionary Input：没有人工的输入；Fear and greed can be overwhelming motivators when carrying out discretionary trading.
- Comparison：能够动态地比较不同策略的效果；
- Higher Frequencies：These strategies are simply impossible for a human to carry out.

### 2.1.2 Disadvantages

- Capital Requirements：需要更大的资金量，这往往是交易商的限制；比如 interactive broker，需要至少 $10000；obtaining data feeds for intraday quantitative strategies, particularly if using futures contracts, is not cheap for the retail trader；Depending upon your latency needs it may be necessary to co-locate a server in an exchange, which increases the monthly costs；
- Programming/Scientific Expertise
