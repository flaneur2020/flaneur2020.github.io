- mentor advise；coaches asses；这是为什么很多人会尝试在管理链条之外寻找 mentorship；
- code review 可能发现一些 teachable moments；但是这不等于 mentoring

Mentors should operate at three levels
- Goals：找出真正想要的
- Situations： 处理不熟悉或者困难的
- Skills：提升
- radical candor – caring personally while challenging directly – is essential to effective mentoring.
- 找出这个人最感兴趣的，同时帮助他们看到 uncomfortable truths

To mentor goals, ask questions.
- Mentoring about goals is tricky because the best goals come from within.
- Goals are most meaningful when they are deeply understood.
- 为了帮助他们理解他们的目标，通过提出问题，反映他们当前的状态，考虑潜在的 future，chart a course from one to another
- probe for how well they understand their current situation
	- what's going well?
	- what's not going well?
	- what about your role do you enjoy the most?
	- what's most frustrating?
	- if you could change one thing, what would it be and why?

To mentor situations, tell stories.
- sharing a related experience reassures a mentee that they’re not alone
- Be honest if you haven’t experienced a situation personally

To mentor skills, observe them in action.
- mentoring skills 是与 coaching 重叠最多的部分；
- 首先，你需要观察 mentee 的 activities 或者 output；
- 最重要的事情是提供 actionable feedback；

What if you want to mentor, but people don’t ask? 
- listen first
