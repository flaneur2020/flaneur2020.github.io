Sleep is important. People vastly underestimate the extent to which not sleeping is harmful, viewing it as a valid trade off for productivity and overlooking all of the longterm negative effects.

## Said Effects Being

- Metabolism slows down, appetite goes up
- Depression, anxiety, irritability, distress
- Increased risk of diabetes
- More substance abuse/addiction (alcohol and caffeine, specifically) [ironically both depressants and stimulants]
- Lower life expectancy
- Lower cognitive performance (specifically in reasoning/logic)
- Long and short term memory issues
- Increased (+33%) risk of dementia which is something you should be terrified of
- Fatigued and demotivated
- Lower libido

## Impact of Those Being

- You get fat
- You might enter a state where consumption of sugar has to be stringently regulated and have to do annoying blood checks which is expensive if you’re in country with a questionable private healthcare system
- No one likes talking to you or being around you in general because you become asshole-ish and/or a loner
- You have to deal with expensive and unhealthy addictions
- More likely to die early!
- more stupid - can’t unlock your full intelligence and cognitive prowess, so you’re stifling potential
- Memory also worsens, see above
- Ooh that decreased cognitive state has a higher chance of being permanent and getting much much worse, making your life miserable
- You lose all ambition so start following others. you also feel dead inside all the time and just want to sleeeep
- to top it all off
- can’t sexually pleasure your partner to their level of desire, leading to strained relations (even more strained, since the aforementioned negative effects on personality likely contribute as well) so they are less useful in helping you deal with all of the above issues.
