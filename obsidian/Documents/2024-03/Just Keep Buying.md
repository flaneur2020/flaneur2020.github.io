## Where Should You Start?

> saving is for the poor and investing is for the rich.

> Compare this to someone with $10 million in investable assets. If they were to see just a 10% decline in their portfolio, they would lose $1 million. Do you think they could save $1 million in a year? Highly unlikely. Unless they have a very high income, their annual savings just can’t compete with the regular fluctuations in their investment portfolio. This is why someone with $10 million has to spend a lot more time thinking about their investment choices compared to someone with only $1,000.

> These examples illustrate that what you should focus on depends on your financial situation. If you don’t have much money invested, then you should focus on increasing your savings (and investing it). However, if you already have a sizable portfolio, then you should spend more time thinking about the details of your investment plan.

> If I had known this at age 23, I would have spent more time developing my career and growing my income instead of questioning my investment decisions. Once I had a bigger nest egg, then I could have fine-tuned my portfolio.

23 岁时应当更多时间花在 career 上，增加自己的收入比研究投资决策更重要。

> First, figure out how much you expect to comfortably save in the next year.

> Next, determine how much you expect your investments to grow in the next year (in dollar terms)

> As you can see, in the first few decades of working, most of their annual change in wealth is being generated by their yearly savings (the darker gray bar). However, in their final few decades, it is their investments (the lighter gray bar) that contribute far more to their yearly growth.

年轻时候省钱对资产积累更有帮助，随着工作攒钱的增长，在总的资产比例中，生活开销占据的比例会越来越小。

## 2. How Much Should You Save? It’s probably less than you think

> Instead of consuming the same number of calories throughout the year, the char change their caloric intake (and their metabolism) based on how much food is available.

> When we have the ability to save more, we should save more—and when we don’t, we should save less. We shouldn’t use static, unchanging rules because our finances are rarely static and unchanging.

> If I had vowed to always save 20% of my income no matter what, then I would have been absolutely miserable during my first year in NYC. And that’s no way to live.

> This is why the best savings advice is: save what you can.


> Instead of calculating every dollar you spend, find your fixed spending and estimate the rest. Your fixed spending is your monthly spending that doesn’t change. This will include: rent/mortgage, internet/cable, subscription services, car payment, etc.
