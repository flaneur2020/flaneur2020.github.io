>  Recently, we covered [what the end of ZIRP means for tech startups and the wider tech sector](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp): more pressure to achieve profitability, less venture capital funding, Big Tech getting bigger, and it’s harder for startups to access funding beyond the seed stage, while bootstrapping becomes more common.

## 1. A decade of ZIRP; a recap

过去的十年不只是移动互联网和云计算的创新，也是来自于，这些创新发生现代历史中最长的一段低利率周期。

过去三十年间有很多技术变革，比如 internet 和 PC 革命（从 90 年代开始，在 2000 年代加速）。但是只有移动互联网和云计算与 ZIRP 重合。

> Low interest rates meant more capital flowed into tech, searching for financial returns of a size no longer available elsewhere due to 0% rates, mostly as venture capital into startups. Simply put, it was easier than ever to raise funding for a tech startup. At the same time, cloud computing and smartphones went mainstream and made it easier to build companies, fast.

期间 VC 比较有钱，容易搞到开一个 start up 的资金。同时，云计算和智能手机进入了主流。

> **Cloud computing brought more efficiency and ease of scalability**
> 
> **Smartphones created a new, initially cheap, distribution channel.**

云计算使得开一家软件 start up 变得更容易。

智能手机产生了一个新的廉价的分发渠道。

下一个 **efficiency and distribution** 在哪里？

> Currently, AI and large language models (LLMs) are what hopes are pinned on to deliver a major efficiency jump. If AI can successfully be integrated into software engineering workflows, we could see it again become faster and cheaper to build software. 
>
> _It’s still unclear how big an improvement AI will deliver, but AI helpers are boosting efficiency, as we covered in an article about [the productivity impact of AI coding tools](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-coding-tools)._

AI 对 Efficiency 有比较高的提高。

但是下一个 Distribution 渠道还没有眉目。企业需要支付昂贵的 Google Ads 搜索流量、Meta 的 Social Media 流量、Apple 的 app store ads、亚马逊的电商流量。

> **The end of the ZIRP period and cheap distribution, can already be felt by those working in tech.** It’s harder to get funding, and harder to reach new customers.

更难得到 funding，也更难得到新的 customer。

## 2. Job market realities

job market 对 developer 和 manager 都变得更 tough 了。

在 2022 年底，layoff 出现了峰值。

对 engineering manager 来讲，job market 是更加 tough 的。

> More competition for entry-level positions, less “shopping around” for seniors

> **Better-known companies and full-remote ones will see more competition than the chart above**

full-remote 的岗位也竞争更加激烈。

> Hard to get visa sponsorship, paid relocation even harder
